## Parcel Tracking Basics

- Parcel status is usually updated daily and sometimes more frequently. So it's imperative to either get the API status on domand or store in db and run a cron job. 

- When a customer wants to track the status of their parcel, you can request results on the go. This is a more safe approach but takes up more resources.

- Also for better UX to provide live updates in push notifications, email notifications. You need to get status update hook or cron job approach.
